# Xamarin-Microcharts
Source code of simple android application which gets information via web requests and builds bar chart using Microcharts library (for xamarin.forms). For this application you should have your own REST service. As my project zip archive has size more than 25MB I cannot upload it here. So, I uploaded only the main parts of my project: 
* MainPage.xaml
* MainPage.xaml.cs
* DeviceInfo.cs

Mention: this project used xamarin forms template.
